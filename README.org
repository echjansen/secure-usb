This script creates a Secure USB backup device for use on any computer.
The script installs a minimal Linux OS to boot from, or alternatively mount the included storage partition on your personal  Linux computer.

** Goals

- Be able to store data on the device (obviously...)
- Data must be encrypted so that *only you* can read it
- The USB device must be bootable to access encrypted data on any physical computer you have access to
- If the USB device is lost and someone plugs it in its own computer, contact details must be readable
- Using the device must be seamless, we already have a hardened setup [[https://github.com/echjansen/secure-arch][(secure-arch]]), we don't want to bother having to type another password

** Features
- Secure USB Backup device
- Secure Linux OS included
- LUKS encryption *Linux* and *Storage*
- BTRFS storage partition (for snapshots)
- Boots on any computer with a USB from included Linux
- Mount storage partition on personal computer automatically

** Requirements
- USB device (minimal 15GB)
- Linux computer to execute this script
- Internet connection to download Linux packages to create the Secure USB

** Partitioning
1. Partition 1: FAT32 (README) partition which contains a README.txt with contact details in case the USB key is lost
2. Partition 2: EFI (EFI) partition with Microsoft signed bootloader (to access your data from any physical computer you have access to)
3. Partition 3: LUKS (LINUX) encrypted partition which contains a minimal Linux install to access your data from any computer
4. Partition 4: LUKS (STORAGE )encrypted partition which will contain all your data

** Creating a Secure USB Backup device
To create a secure USB backup device execute the following commands on a linux operating system, after inserting your USB device in the computer.

#+begin_src shell
  git clone https://github.com/echjansen/secure-usb
  cd secure-usb
  sudo secure-usb.py
#+end_src

The script will ask you the following questions:
1. Select the correct USB device (do not make a mistake, as the content will be wiped)
2. A user name
3. A user and drive password (single login)
4. A drive name (in case you create multiple secure USB backup devices)
5. Option to wipe the USB drive with random data (can take a long time)

** Using a Secure USB Backup device
There are two options to use the Secure USB Backup device:

1. Plugin the Secure USB Backup device and reboot the machine to boot from the USB device
2. Mount the storage partition on your personal computer

To mount the storage partition:

#+begin_src shell
  lsblk                                       # To determine the correct drive. Storage is the 4th partition
  sudo blkid </dev/PARTITION>                 # To get block id
  sudo cryptsetup open </dev/partiton> <UUID> # Opens the crypt
  sudo mount </dev/partiton/uuid> /mnt        # Mount on /mnt
#+end_src

To un-mount the storage partition:

#+begin_src shell
  sudo umount /mnt                            # Mount on /mnt
  sudo cryptsetup close <UUID>                # Opens the crypt
#+end_src
