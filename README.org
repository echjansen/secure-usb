** Creating a Secure USB Backup device
To create a secure USB backup device execute the following commands on a linux operating system, after inserting your USB device in the computer.

#+begin_src shell
  git clone https://github.com/echjansen/secure-usb
  cd secure-usb
  sudo secure-usb.py
#+end_src

The script will ask you the following questions:
1. Select the correct USB device (do not make a mistake, as the content will be wiped)
2. A user name
3. A user and drive password (single login)
4. A drive name (in case you create multiple secure USB backup devices)
5. Option to wipe the USB drive with random data (can take a long time)

** Using a Secure USB Backup device
There are two options to use the Secure USB Backup device:

1. Plugin the Secure USB Backup device and reboot the machine to boot from the USB device
2. Mount the storage partition on your personal computer

To mount the storage partition:

#+begin_src shell
  lsblk                           # To determine the correct drive. Storage is the 4th partition
  sudo cryptsetup open <UUID>
#+end_src
